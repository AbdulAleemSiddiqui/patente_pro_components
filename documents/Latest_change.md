# June 2026 Architecture Refactor (Latest Status)

## Completed Since Original Project Plan

A full structural audit was performed before beginning Supabase integration.

### Audit Findings

#### App.jsx was a monolith

The original application consisted of a single 1000+ line `App.jsx` file containing:

* Hardcoded mock datasets (`STUDENTS`, `TEACHERS`, `LESSONS`)
* No route separation
* No authentication guard
* No page-level structure
* No connection to Supabase despite helper files existing

The UI worked visually but was not production-ready.

#### Routing Missing

`react-router-dom` was installed but not implemented.

Every URL loaded the same dashboard view.

#### Auth Missing

No authentication flow existed.

The application had no protected routes and no role-based redirects.

#### Supabase Not Connected

The application displayed a configuration badge but did not read any real data from Supabase.

## Refactor Completed

### Step 1 — Vite Preparation

`vite.config.js` replaced in preparation for PWA support.

Current status:

* Vite working
* PWA plugin preparation completed
* Full PWA configuration still pending

### Step 2 — Zustand Authentication Store

Created:

src/store/useAuthStore.js

Responsibilities:

* User state
* Role state
* Initialization flow
* Demo fallback mode when Supabase is not configured

Current behavior:

* If Supabase credentials do not exist:

  * User automatically becomes Admin
  * Login screen is skipped
  * Application loads in demo mode

### Step 3 — Router Layer

Created:

src/router/AppRouter.jsx

Responsibilities:

* Route definitions
* Protected route handling
* Login route
* Admin route entry point
* Future teacher/student route expansion

### Step 4 — main.jsx Refactor

main.jsx now:

* Boots Zustand auth store
* Loads AppRouter
* Prepares application for React Router
* Removes direct monolithic rendering

### Step 5 — App.jsx Decomposition

The monolithic App.jsx was split into reusable pages and components.

New structure:

src/
├── components/
│   ├── Layout.jsx
│   └── ui.jsx
│
├── pages/
│   ├── DashboardPage.jsx
│   ├── StudentsPage.jsx
│   ├── LessonLogPage.jsx
│   ├── SettingsPage.jsx
│   ├── UsersPage.jsx
│   ├── SchedulePage.jsx
│   ├── ManoeuvresPage.jsx
│   └── SwapPage.jsx
│
├── router/
│   └── AppRouter.jsx
│
├── store/
│   └── useAuthStore.js
│
└── App.jsx

App.jsx is now intentionally thin and acts as a route shell rather than a feature container.

* ✅ Mock data moved to seeded database tables

### Admin User Creation System (June 9, 2026)

**Problem Solved:**
- Needed a way for admins to create teachers/students
- Required coordination between `auth.users` (Supabase Auth) and `public.users` (application data)
- Users logged in without `tenant_id` in metadata caused creation failures

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **New Files Created:**
   - `src/lib/adminApi.js` - Admin API functions using service role key
   - `supabase/migrations/202606090004_ensure_admin_user.sql` - Admin user sync

2. **Updated Files:**
   - `src/pages/UsersPage.jsx` - Added user creation modal and form
   - `src/lib/auth.js` - Added `updateUserMetadata()` function
   - `src/store/useAuthStore.js` - Auto-fetches tenant_id from DB if missing
   - `.env.local` - Added `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

3. **Data Flow:**
   ```
   Admin fills form → Supabase Admin API creates auth.users
                    → Code inserts into public.users with same ID
                    → Stores tenant_id in auth metadata
   ```

4. **Functions Available:**
   - `createUser()` - Creates auth + public.users entries
   - `sendPasswordResetEmail()` - Send password reset links
   - `deleteUser()` - Remove users from both tables
   - Auto tenant_id fetching on login/init

5. **How to Use:**
   1. Run migration `202606090004_ensure_admin_user.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   2. Add service role key to `.env.local`
   3. Restart dev server
   4. Login as admin
   5. Navigate to Users page
   6. Click "Invite Teacher" or "Invite Student"
   7. Fill form and submit

6. **User Creation Flow:**
   ```
   ┌──────────────────┐
   │  Admin Form      │
   │  (React App)     │
   └────────┬─────────┘
            │ createUser() called
            ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │  Supabase Admin API              │
   │  (service_role_key required)     │
   └────────┬─────────────────────────┘
            │ Creates auth user
            ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │  auth.users (Supabase managed)   │
   │  - id: uuid                      │
   │  - email: john@school.com        │
   │  - encrypted_password: ...       │
   └────────┬─────────────────────────┘
            │ Returns user ID
            ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │  public.users (Your table)       │
   │  - id: (FK to auth.users)       │
   │  - tenant_id: ...                │
   │  - role: teacher/student        │
   │  - full_name, email, phone       │
   └──────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

## 🆕 Latest Features (June 12-13, 2026)

### Teacher Availability & Calendar Integration

**Problem Solved:**
- Teachers need a way to set their availability for lesson scheduling
- Admins needed to check if teachers are available before scheduling lessons
- Needed a unified calendar interface instead of separate pages

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Database Schema Updated** (`supabase/migrations/202606060001_initial_schema.sql`):
   - Changed `teacher_availability` from weekly recurring (`day_of_week`, `start_time`, `end_time`) to date-specific blocks (`start_at`, `end_at`)
   - Added `tenant_id` column for proper multi-tenancy
   - Updated indexes for performance

2. **New API Functions** (`src/lib/api.js`):
   - `listTeacherAvailability({ tenantId, teacherId, from, to })` - Fetch availability for date range
   - `createTeacherAvailability({ tenantId, teacherId, startAt, endAt })` - Create availability block
   - `deleteTeacherAvailability({ id })` - Delete availability block
   - `updateLesson({ id, ... })` - Update existing lessons
   - `deleteLesson({ id })` - Delete lessons

3. **Combined Calendar** (`src/pages/SchedulePage.jsx`):
   - **Type-Choice Popup**: Admins selecting time slots see "Schedule Lesson" or "Add Teacher Availability" options
   - **Availability Rendering**: Light, semi-transparent colors with left border (available lessons remain solid)
   - **Month View**: Shows both lesson count and distinct teacher availability count per day
   - **Smart Teacher Filtering**: Teacher dropdown only shows teachers who:
     - Have availability covering the selected time slot
     - Have no conflicting lessons during that time
   - **Lesson Editing**: Admins can edit lesson start time and duration (end time auto-calculated)
   - **Conflict Checking**: Cannot delete availability if lessons are scheduled during that time
   - **Delete Functionality**: Delete buttons added to both Lesson and Availability modals

4. **Teacher Feedback Flow**:
   - Teachers clicking on lessons in Day View see "Give Lesson Feedback" modal
   - On confirmation, redirects to Log lesson page with pre-filled, read-only lesson details
   - Supports easy lesson feedback submission for completed lessons

5. **Navigation Updated** (`src/lib/roleAccess.js`):
   - Removed "Availability" menu item (now integrated into Schedule page)
   - Removed availability page references from routing

## Technical Details

### Availability Data Model

```sql
CREATE TABLE teacher_availability (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  teacher_id uuid not null references users(id) on delete cascade,
  tenant_id uuid not null references tenants(id) on delete cascade,
  start_at timestamptz not null,
  end_at timestamptz not null,
  check (start_at < end_at)
);
```

### Conflict Detection Logic

When deleting availability:
- System checks for lessons scheduled during the availability period
- Excludes cancelled lessons
- Shows warning with student names and lesson details
- Blocks deletion until lessons are rescheduled/cancelled

### Teacher Availability Checking

For scheduling and editing:
- Checks if teacher has availability block covering entire lesson duration
- Checks for conflicting lessons (excluding current lesson when editing)
- Returns only teachers who pass both checks
- Shows helpful count messages ("X of Y teachers available")
